# miniRT
This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of Raytracing. Once completed we will be able to render simpleComputer-Generated-Images and we will never be afraid of implementing mathematical formulas again.
   

## Introduction
The main goal of miniRT is to prove to ourself that we are able to implement any mathematics or physics formulas without being a mathematician, we will only implement the most basics ray tracing features here so just keep calm, take a deep breath and don’t
panic! After this project we’ll be able to show off nice looking pictures.

+ [miniRT_subject](/miniRT_subject.pdf)

## How To Use
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run the `make` or `make bonus` (for rotation and translation with keyboard) command.
ps : this project is only tested in MAC os, I don't know it's behavios in other os.
3. The programm takes a scene as an argument. Multiple scenes are directly available in the directory "./scenes/" .
    ```
    $ ./miniRT './scenes/file_name'
    ```
4. save flag
    ```
    $ ./miniRT './scenes/file_name' --save
    ```
5. Keyboard

- `[r | t]`: Rotation | Translation
- `[x | y | z]`: Rotation over axe [ x | y | z]
- `[o | c | l]`: Chosing [Object | Camera | Light]
- `[Right/Left | Up/Down | W/S]`: For moving
